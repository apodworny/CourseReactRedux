### Project 6 - widgets
A project created to understand hooks in React. Routing is also implemented, without using a third party library.

The Accordion page is simply an accordion menu, there's not much functionality there.

The second page uses a user-input search term to query the Wikipedia API. It provides a short description of potential matches, and a link to their respective Wikipedia pages.

The third page is a custom dropdown implemented in React.

The fourth page uses the google translate API to translate English to the selected language. Note that due to the google translate API being a paid service, the translate page of this project will only work if you are running the project on "localhost:3000". So that portion will not work on the below link.
