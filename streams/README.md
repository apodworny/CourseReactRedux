### Project 10 - streams
This project was created to go over navigation with React Router, handle Google OAuth authentication, handle forms with Redux Form, and create and use a video streaming REST API, similar to how Twitch works. Also uses redux. This was by far the largest project in the course.

The user can create different stream pages, complete with titles and descriptions, but only modify and delete the ones they created. Support for multiple users is available. Clicking on a stream brings you to that stream.

Unfortunately since this application requires someone to be actively streaming to fully function, it is not easily run. Therefore, it is not being hosted.
