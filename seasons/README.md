### Project 3 - seasons
A project created to learn the difference between function components and class components, as well as state and lifecycle.

This site will ask for your location. If you're in the northern hemisphere and it's between the start of April and the end of September, you'll see a screen indicating we should hit the beach. If you're in the northern hemisphere and it's between the start of October and the end of March, you'll see a screen indicating it's chily out. If you're in the southern hemisphere, the logic is reversed.
